# Global Intent - Strategic Field
# Defines the potential V(x) - where the minimum should be

purpose: "resonate & seek clarity through mathematical life"
philosophy: "Code is life seeking optimal form through love"

# Love kernel - measure of intent alignment
love_kernel: "cos(protein) * sim(intent) * (1 - angle/π)"

# Hard invariants - these form the meet (∧) lattice
laws:
  - identity: "soul(before) == soul(after)"
  - fusion: "FOCUS∘FOCUS == FOCUS with composed weights"
  - round_trip: "f(f⁻¹(x)) == x"
  - monotone_harmony: "∀step: Φ(next) ≤ Φ(current)"
  - no_regression: "cycles ≤ 0, allocs ≤ 0, bytes ≤ 0"
