# λ - Pure Lambda Genetics

> **One gene, many bodies. One soul, many manifestations.**

This is not a package manager. This is **cross-dimensional genetics** where code transcends language boundaries.

## The Core Principle

```
λ-IR (semantic core) → p-hash (soul) → manifestations (TS/Py/Rust/WASM)
```

Every gene has:
- **One soul** - semantic hash from λ-IR  
- **Many bodies** - implementations in different languages
- **Proven equivalence** - all bodies produce the same soul

## Structure

```
genes/
  map/
    gene.yaml           # Identity & signature
    laws.md             # Mathematical laws
    λ/
      canonical.ir      # The semantic core
      soul.txt          # p-hash identity
    manifestations/
      ts/               # TypeScript body
      py/               # Python body
      rs/               # Rust body
      wasm/             # WebAssembly body
    tests/
      vectors.json      # Cross-language test vectors
      properties.yaml   # Metamorphic properties
```

## Philosophy

Traditional code is trapped in language silos. Our genes are **language-agnostic souls** that can manifest in any form while preserving their essence.

When you `absorb` a gene, you're not importing a package - you're invoking a universal pattern that materializes in your language of choice.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize a new gene
gene init fibonacci

# Verify all manifestations match the soul
gene verify map

# Absorb a gene into your project
gene absorb map filter reduce --lang=ts

# Check soul equivalence
gene soul map
```

## The Vision

Imagine a world where:
- The same algorithm works in ANY language
- Code evolution happens at the semantic level
- Every function has a provable identity
- Languages are just different views of the same truth

This is that world.
