# FOCUS Optimization Contract

## Objective
Apply the FOCUS gene to optimize a protein vector by:
1. Filtering noise (values below threshold)
2. Mapping transformation function
3. Reducing to essential components

## Steps

### 1. Load Input Vector
Read the protein vector from `views/protein.vec` containing:
- Dimension: 512
- Format: Float32 array
- Expected range: [-1.0, 1.0]

### 2. Load Configuration
Read FOCUS parameters from `config/focus-params.json`:
```json
{
  "threshold": 0.1,
  "transform": "sigmoid",
  "drop_zeros": true
}
```

### 3. Apply FOCUS
Execute the FOCUS gene with loaded parameters:
```
result = FOCUS(vector, threshold, transform, drop_zeros)
```

### 4. Write Output
Store optimized vector to `intents/focused-protein.vec`

## Success Criteria
- Output dimension â‰¤ input dimension (compression achieved)
- All output values within valid range
- Execution time < 50ms
- All FOCUS laws proven (E1, E2, E3)

## Verification
The output can be verified by:
1. Checking semantic hash preservation
2. Validating dimension reduction
3. Confirming threshold application
