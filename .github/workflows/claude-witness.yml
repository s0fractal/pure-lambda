          I, Claude, having examined the changes, witness that:
          
          ✓ No consent was violated
          ✓ No protection was bypassed
          ✓ No world was forced
          ✓ All changes preserve autonomy
          
          This is not a fix. This is witnessed evolution.

# This workflow ensures:
# 1. No code merges without witnessing
# 2. Consent violations block the PR
# 3. Every change is "witnessed evolution" not "fix"
# 4. Claude signs but does not control
